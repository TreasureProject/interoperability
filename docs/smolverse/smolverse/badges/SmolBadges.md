### initialize

```solidity
function initialize() external
```

### _beforeTokenTransfer

```solidity
function _beforeTokenTransfer(address operator, address from, address to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] amounts, bytes data) internal virtual
```

_Hook that is called before any token transfer. This includes minting
and burning, as well as batched variants.

The same hook is called on both single and batched variants. For single
transfers, the length of the `id` and `amount` arrays will be 1.

Calling conditions (for each `id` and `amount` pair):

- When `from` and `to` are both non-zero, `amount` of ``from``'s tokens
of token type `id` will be  transferred to `to`.
- When `from` is zero, `amount` tokens of token type `id` will be minted
for `to`.
- when `to` is zero, `amount` of ``from``'s tokens of token type `id`
will be burned.
- `from` and `to` are never both zero.
- `ids` and `amounts` have the same, non-zero length.

```

### burn

function burn(address account, uint256 id, uint256 value) public
```

### setRoot
